To create a wallet type in your desired password in the create section, then click the “Create” button. You will be prompted to download a Keystore/Secret Key File. A Secret Key File contains all your login information, but its contents are encrypted with your password. Without either one you will not be able to access your wallet. Make sure you store the file in a safe and secure place - that’s the only way to access your wallet and only you are responsible for it. We do not store any user access details.

When you are there, you can either directly open the QR code scanner or paste the address where you would like to send your coins. Make sure to pay extra attention to the correctness of the receiving address, and never type it manually due to the high risk of making a mistake! Always double-check the address you are going to send Dentacoin to because you will not be able to cancel the transaction or request a refund.<br>
                                Then you click “Next”. You will arrive at the screen where you can specify the amount you would like to send. You can type the amount of necessary Dentacoin in the “DCN” field you require or in USD (it will calculate the amount in chosen coin/token based on the current exchange rate).<br>
                                The transaction fee is calculated automatically and is deducted from your Ethereum balance.
                                Please double check if the “Send to” address is correct and if it is not, you can edit it by pressing the pencil button next to it. When you are ready clicking send will commit the transaction. There is no turning back at this point.

Inputting the amount of USD you are willing to commit on the left side will automatically calculate the amount of Dentacoin you will receive (including fees) under the “You get” field. The opposite works vice-versa - if you input the amount of Dentacoin you would like to receive the required amount of USD to make the purchase will automatically be calculated and shown in the “Pay with” field. Once you are satisfied with the amount you would like to commit/receive it is time to input the receiving address. If you would like to purchase Dentacoin for your own wallet, then the address field is automatically filled when you navigate to the “Buy” section, but you are free to edit the field if you’d like to receive it on another address. After that please input a valid email address, so you can begin the verification procedures needed to process your transaction. The final step before you can move forward is to read the Privacy Policy and tick the box, if you consent. Please double check that the information is correct and if you are certain it is, you can click the “Buy” button to begin the verification process.

The phone number is needed to receive a 4 digit verification code. Keep in mind that the phone number should be associated with your card information. After you’ve input your phone number you will be taken to the next step, where you will be asked to provide a scan, or photo of your ID, Passport, or Driver’s License to complete the verification process. Additionally, you might be required to undergo video verification, where you record a video, by showing your face. These are all necessary steps for Indacoin to verify that you are the card holder and not someone using a stolen card. If you cannot record a video verification, you can open the same order page link from your mobile device and record it from there. If that is not possible, you can send the video over email to <a href="mailto:support@indacoin.com">support@indacoin.com</a> , but make sure you include your order number as well. Fortunately, once your card is verified, you will not need to do so, during your next purchase.</div>

This fee goes to miners who confirm your transaction. The fees are calculated automatically for Dentacoin Wallet transactions. Since Dentacoin is built on the Ethereum network, the transaction fees are paid with minute amounts of Ether called Ether gas. That is why in order to process a transaction you need to charge your Dentacoin wallet with Ether, beforehand.</div>

Click the little fox icon at the top right of your browser to open up the MetaMask extension and after agreeing to the Terms and Conditions, you will be prompted to create a new account.

If you forget your password and you lose your seed phrase you will lose all access to your account and it cannot be restored anymore. Make sure you keep it in a safe and secure place!
